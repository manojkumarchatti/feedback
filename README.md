# Employee Feedback Platform

This repository describes the architecture and implementation plan for an employee feedback platform built with React, .NET, MySQL, and Microsoft single sign-on (SSO).

## Overview

The platform enables employees to submit feedback, managers to review and respond, and administrators to analyze engagement trends. It combines a React front-end, a .NET 8 Web API back-end, and a MySQL database, all secured with Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) single sign-on.

See the documents in [`docs/`](docs/) for details on architecture, implementation, and deployment.
